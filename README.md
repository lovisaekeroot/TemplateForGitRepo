# TemplateForGitRepo
This is a template for creating and working with a GitHub repository for myself.
Note: This is not for working with branches. Only with one main branch for simplicity.

## Step 1:
Create a GitHub Repository with a name and have the "Add README.md" added in the creation of the repository.
